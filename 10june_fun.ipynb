    "To Terminate the Function Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "i.The return statement also acts as a termination point for the function.\n",
    "ii.When a return statement is encountered, the function immediately exits, and the control flow is returned to the caller.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "iii.Function Body: Lambda functions have a single expression as their body, while regular functions can have multiple statements and more complex logic.\n",

    "iii.Local variables have a limited lifespan and are created when the function is called, and they cease to exist when the function completes execution or returns.\n",
    "iv.Local variables can have the same name as variables in other scopes without causing conflicts because they are independent and separate from variables in other scopes.\n",

    "ii.Variables defined outside of all functions or classes are considered global and can be accessed from anywhere within the program, including inside functions.\n",
    "iii.Global variables have a broader scope and a longer lifespan compared to local variables.\n",
